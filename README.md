Task: Create a photocopier UI 

Create a high-fidelity prototype of the photocopy machine (submitted as a team, only one submission)

Iterate on all the paper prototypes of each team member to create a revised paper prototype for the whole team.
Using this prototype as a basis, create a hi-fidelity version (we recommend keeping it simple using html + javascript).
Submit a video that showcases your hi-fi prototype.
