Turns out that humans don't really hear all frequencies the same (e.g., with the same intensity, clarity, etc).
So to figure out how humans really perceive different audible frequencies we created this hearing test.

This test features pre test calibration, testing at different frequencies, white noise to counteract background noises and a display of your results. 

Interpreting the results: 
The results will come in the form of a table (Frequency, Loudness, WhiteNoise)

This table shows how much you have to crank up the volume in order to hear each frequency. Some of this is natural (our
ears are buildt to hear some frequencies better than others), some of this might be due to hearing loss (if you listen to a lot
of loud music, you might loose some of your ability to hear high-frequency sounds), part of it is also due to our technology. 
Most speakers output different frequencies at different volumes, they do not produce a "flat" frequency response, so that might influence the test.

This test was programmed for a human-computer-interaction class tought by Pedro Lopes: http://plopes.org/
